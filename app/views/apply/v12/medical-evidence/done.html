    <p class="govuk-body-l">There may be a delay in processing your application
      because of the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
    <p>Please do not contact the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for an update.</p>
    <p>Youâ€™ll receive a notification as soon as possible.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Send us supporting medical evidence</h3>

    <p>From 10 July, you will need to send us medical evidence to support your application. We accept these medical certificates:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Fit note (also called a statement of fitness for work or a sick note)</li>
      <li>Med10 (a hospital certificate given to inpatients if your treatment lasts more than 7 days)</li>
      <li>MATB1 (if you're pregnant but you cannot get Statutory Maternity Pay or Maternity Allowance)</li>
      <li>CF73 (a form issued by a psychiatric hospital)</li>
      <li>DS1500 (a form completed by a doctor, consultant or specialist nurse if they think you might not live longer than 6 months, because of your condition)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other forms of evidence might include a doctor's statement, consultant's report or Local Authority notice.</p>

    <p>You do not need to send medical evidence if you're claiming New Style ESA because of coronavirus.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How to send your evidence</h3>

    <p>If you have a fit note that's signed by your doctor, you can use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/send-fit-note" target="_blank">Send Your Fit Note service (opens in a new window)</a> to send it to us online.</p>

    <p>If you have another form of medical evidence, you can send it to us by post. You can also post your fit note.</p>
