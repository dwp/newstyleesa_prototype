     This has taken a lot of work and involved a lot of internal and external stakeholders. Because of the sign off required, it went into the service just before private beta began so we have not had time to test the content properly. There is a lot more content than we would usually provide, and some phrasing could be clearer.  In particular we need to check they understand who they are giving consent to (since it isn‘t us), what will happen if they say yes, what will happen if they say no, how they can change their response, and why we ask for it. We have agreed with colleagues in Strategy, Legal and Data Protection that we will test comprehension fully during private beta and if necessary try out new designs. But we need to keep them informed of any research findings, and share any designs we are testing.

    This is not in the clerical form, and there were a number of differing opinions about whether we need to ask this at all.

    Research has shown that this is a difficult question. On the clerical form, users often leave it blank or put things like ‘ASAP’. This is not possible on the digital form and they need to put a full date. We know that users struggle to understand the rules around backdating and eligibility and that changing their claim start dates later can be laborious and time consuming for processors. At the moment we are just trying to explain the basic rules and reassure users that we will check it before it is sent (users got nervous when giving a date that they are not sure is right - they know they might have to pay money back if they do it wrong). We have tried a new design where in some cases we give the user the date we think they can claim from, based on information they have given us - for example, the end date for their SSP. It needs more testing, and discussion with stakeholders to make sure we do not misadvise claimants.
